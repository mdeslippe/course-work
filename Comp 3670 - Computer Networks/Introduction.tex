\section*{\centering{Introduction}}

    \subsection*{Network Hosts and Communication Links}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{network host} is a computational device that is connected to a network.
        \item \textbf{Hosts} may work as a \textbf{server} offering \textbf{information resources, services, and applications} to users and other hosts.
        \item \textbf{Hosts} are assigned a unique \textbf{network address}.
        \item The \textbf{network edge} refers to the area where a \textbf{device or local network interfaces with a large network}.
        \item A \textbf{link} is a \textbf{communication channel} that connects two or more devices for the purpose of \textbf{data transmission}.
        \item \textbf{Bandwidth} refers to the \textbf{maximum rate data can be transmitted over a link}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection*{Packets and Packet Switching}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Packet Switching} is a method of \textbf{grouping data into packets} that are transmitted over a network.
        \item A \textbf{network packet} is a formatted unit of data carried by a \textbf{packet-switched network}.
        \item \textbf{Packets} consist of \textbf{control information, and the payload}.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Network Devices}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{modem} or a \textbf{modulator-demodulator} is a computer networking device that \textbf{converts data} between a \textbf{digital format, and an analog format} for the purpose of transmission.
        \item A \textbf{router} is a computer networking device that \textbf{creates and manages a local network}, and \textbf{manages the data entering and exiting the network}.
        \item A \textbf{switch} is a computer networking device that \textbf{connects devices via packet switching} to \textbf{receive and forward data}.
        \item \textbf{Routers use IP addresses} to route data, and \textbf{switches use MAC addresses} to route data.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Network Terminologies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{bit (binary digit)} is a single unit of information.
        \item A \textbf{physical link} is the physical \textbf{communication link} that \textbf{connects transmitters and receivers}.
        \item \textbf{Guided media} refers to signals that \textbf{propagate in a solid medium}.
        \item \textbf{Unguided media} refers to \textbf{signals that propagate freely}. 
        \item \textbf{Routing} refers to the process of determining the \textbf{path a packet will take} to reach it's destination.
        \item \textbf{Forwarding} refers to the \textbf{process of receiving a packed, and sending it to the next node in the path}. 
    \end{itemize}

\section*{\centering{The Internet}}
    \subsection*{The Internet}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Internet} is a \textbf{global computer network} that provides a variety of \textbf{information and communication facilities}.
        \item \textbf{The Internet} consists of \textbf{interconnected networks} using \textbf{standardized communication protocols}.
        \item A \textbf{communication protocol} is a \textbf{system of rules that allows two or more entities to communicate of the internet}.
        \item \textbf{Protocols} define the \textbf{rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization} of the communication.
        \item The \textbf{internet network core} refers to the infrastructure (routers) that connect networks together.
   \end{itemize}

   \subsection*{Internet Service Providers and Access Networks}
   \begin{itemize}
       \item An \textbf{Internet service provider} is an organization that \textbf{provides services for accessing, and using the internet}.
       \item One way an \textbf{ISP} can provide their customers with \textbf{internet access} is through \textbf{existing telephone lines (Digital Subscriber Lines or DLS)}.
       \item \textbf{DSL} was mainly used when the \textbf{internet was first created}, and is often referred to as \textbf{dial up}.
       \item The \textbf{problem} with \textbf{DLS} is that it only supports a single connection.
       \item A more-modern way \textbf{ISPs} provide their customers with \textbf{internet access} is with \textbf{cable-based access}.
       \item \textbf{Cable-based access} uses \textbf{frequency division multiplexing (FDM)} to \textbf{transmit data in different channels} allowing for several connections simultaneously.
       \item There are different types of \textbf{cables} such as \textbf{Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)}, and \textbf{Fiber Optic Cables}.
       \item Another way \textbf{ISPs} provide their customers with \textbf{internet access} is through \textbf{wireless access points (WAPs)}.
       \item \textbf{WAPs use electromagnetic radiation} to \textbf{transmit information} over different frequencies.
   \end{itemize}

   \subsection*{The Network Core}
   \begin{itemize}
       \item \textbf{The Network Core} is a mesh of \textbf{interconnected routers} that use \textbf{packet-switching} to transmit data.
       \item \textbf{Transmission delay} refers to the amount of time it takes for a packet to transmit.
       \item \textbf{Transmission delay} can be \textbf{calculated} with the following formula $\text{Delay}=\frac{L}{R}$ where $L$ is the \textbf{length of the packet}, and $R$ is the \textbf{transmission rate of the link in bits per second}.
       \item \textbf{Routers} use the \textbf{store and forward principal}; before they can \textbf{forward packets}, they have to \textbf{wait until the entire packet has arrived}.
       \item If the \textbf{arrival rate} of a packet \textbf{exceeds the transmission rate of a link} the packet will be \textbf{placed into a queue} for a short period of time; If the queue \textbf{runs out of memory} unsent packets will be \textbf{overwritten, causing packet loss}.
   \end{itemize}

   \subsection*{The Internet Structure}
   \begin{itemize}
       \item \textbf{Hosts} connect to the internet via \textbf{Access Internet Service Providers}.
       \item \textbf{ISPs are then interconnected}.
       \item There are different \textbf{tiers} of ISPs:
       \item[] \includegraphics[height=175px]{images/ISP-Structure.png}
       \item The \textbf{ISP tiers} can have \textbf{peer-to-peer links} where they are \textbf{directly connected}, or they can have an \textbf{internet exchange point} which is an external network where \textbf{several networks can exchange data}.
       \item \textbf{Context network providers} (Google, Microsoft, etc) may also run \textbf{their own networks} that are connected to the \textbf{internet}.
   \end{itemize}
