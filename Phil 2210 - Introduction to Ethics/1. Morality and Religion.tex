    \section*{\centering{Morality and Religion}}

    \subsection*{Attempts to Ground Morality in Religion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is a widely held view that there is an \textbf{intimate connection} between \textbf{morality and religion}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This implies that if there is no god, then there is no morality.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Even if there is a connection between \textbf{morality and religion}, attempts to \textbf{understand} this connection so far have \textbf{failed}.
        \item Two \textbf{popular} attempts to \textbf{understand the connection} between \textbf{morality and religion} are \textbf{Divine Command Theory}, and \textbf{Natural Law Theory.}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Divine Command Theory (DCT)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{roots} of \textbf{DCT} have their origin in the writings of \textbf{Plato} in a dialogue called \textbf{The Euthyphro}.
        \item The basic ideas of \textbf{DCT} can be summarized as follows: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item An act is \textbf{obligatory} if God commands it (tells you to do it).
            \item An act is \textbf{permissible} if God permits it.
            \item An act is \textbf{forbidden} if God forbids it (tells you to not do it).
        \end{enumerate}
        \item This raises the question: "How do you know what God commands?"
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some people believe that it is found in \textbf{religious scripture}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item An \textbf{ontological problem} (a problem in the study of existance) that relates to \textbf{DCT} is: how do we know that God exists?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There is an ontological proof that goes as follows: God's essence is perfection. It is more perfect to exist than to not exist. Thus, God exists.
            \item However, not everyone accepts theological proofs of God's existance.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Some defenders of \textbf{DCT} believe that it is \textbf{not necessary} to \textbf{believe in God} to adhere to \textbf{DCT}. They would instead argue that \textbf{only if God exists}, morality is possible. So they are giving an account of what morality would be if there were a God.
        \item An \textbf{epistemological problem} (a problem about how we know something) with \textbf{DCT} is: even if God exists, how do we \textbf{know} what \textbf{God's commands are}?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some would argue that we know through \textbf{scripture, prayer, meditation, and religious experiences}.
            \item Adams claims that all \textbf{wrong actions} have one thing in common; they are \textbf{contrary} to the \textbf{commands} of a \textbf{loving God}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{The Major Problem with DCT}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{major problem} with \textbf{DCT} was put forward by \textbf{Plato} in \textbf{Euthyphro}. The \textbf{problem} is known as the \textbf{Euthyprho dilemma}.
        \item The \textbf{Euthyprho dilemma is as follows}: Does god command an action because it is right, or is the action right because God commands it?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Suppose an action X is right, simply because God commands it. Doesn't that make morality arbitrary? It can be whatver God wants? He can change the commands at any time. God could command us to do something that we think is immoral.
            \item Suppose an action X is right, then God will command it. But this means, that religion is based on morality instead of morality being based on religion. God is essentially acting as a messanger for something above him.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This dilemma leads us to \textbf{abandon DCT}. Though there have been attempts to resuscitate it.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item One theory that attempted to save DCT is \textbf{A New Device Command Theory} by \textbf{Robert Adams}. To get around the \textbf{Euthrphro dilemma} it modifies \textbf{DCT} as follows: An act is morally right if is commanded by a \textbf{loving God}; a loving god would never command us to do something that is morally wrong by our moral intuitions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}    

    \subsection*{Natural Law Theory (NLT)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since not every accepts solutions proposed to the \textbf{Euthyphro dilemma}, \textbf{St. Thomas Aquinas} proposed an alternative way of grounding morality in religion. This was is \textbf{Natural Law Theory}.
        \item \textbf{Natural Law Theory} can be summarized in terms of three theses:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Every event and every action has a \textbf{purpose}.
            \item There are \textbf{laws of nature} that represent the \textbf{purposes} of actions and events.
            \item God provides us with the \textbf{ability to reason} in order to comprehend the \textbf{laws of nature}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item In \textbf{NLT}, moral laws are \textbf{laws of nature}, not \textbf{commands of God}. God enters into morality only at the level of \textbf{providing us with the ability to reason}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This allows NLT to avoid the problems that exist with DCT.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Essentially, \textbf{NLT} is a theory that it is \textbf{immoral to use things in a way that does not fit their purpose}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An example would be: arms were created to life things, using them for any other purpose (such as to hit someone) is morally wrong.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Problems with NLT}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One problem with \textbf{NLT} is that it is not clear that \textbf{every event has a purpose}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For example, we do not have eyes for the purpose of seeing, rather we have eyes as an evolutionary adaptation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Another problem with \textbf{NLT} is that it commits the \textbf{naturalistic fallacy} (infering "should" from "is"). We are deducing moral oughts from "the purpose an event is". 
        \item Arguably the most serious object is that an \textbf{atheist} could still \textbf{act morally} since having the ability to reason \textbf{does not depend} on \textbf{believing in God}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implying God is irrelevant, since one could be moral without believing in God.
        \end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Moral Codes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Another approach to ground morality in religion, discuessed by \textbf{James Rachels}, is that \textbf{religious scriptures can be regarded as moral codes}.
        \item To determine if an act is morally right or morally wrong, you consult the scripture.
        \item The problem with this approach is that \textbf{scripture is open to interpretation}. You could interperate it \textbf{literally, metaphorically, historically, etc}. People can also take scripture passages out of context, or ignore the meaning of the terms at that time in history.
    \end{itemize}
