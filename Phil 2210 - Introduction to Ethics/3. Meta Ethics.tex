    \section*{\centering{The Nature of Moral Value}}

    \subsection*{The Nature of Moral Value}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{J. L. Mackie} (a moral anti-realist) believes that there are \textbf{no universal more values} based on \textbf{relativistic arguments}.
        \item \textbf{Mackie} argues for what he calls \textbf{moral skepticism}, which is the view that \textbf{there are no objective values}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is distinguished from \textbf{moral objectivism} which involves  the view that \textbf{there are objective values}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Before his arguments, he makes a couple of distinctions first:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item He distinguishes moral skepticism from the following views:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Our current system of values needs to be replaced with a better system of values.
                \item No existing system of moral values is adequate.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item He distinguishes second-order mmoral questions from first-order moral question.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item First-order moral questions are concerned with moral values.
                \item Second-order moral questions are concerned with the possible existence of objective moral values, independently of any system of values.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item He distinguishes moral skepticism from simple subjectivism.
            \item He distinguishes the thesis that \textbf{there are objective moral values} fomr the thesis that \textbf{there are inter-subjective values}.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item One could be a moral skeptic while still believing that there are inner-subjective values shared across both individuals and cultures.
                \item These inter subjective values may still not be objective in the sense that they are true for all time.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Mackie proposed the following two arguments for his \textbf{moral skepticism position}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The argument from the ontological (what exists) and epistemological (what we know) \textbf{weirdness of objective moral values}.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Ontological weirdness: If there are objective moral values, they are not visible nor are they tangible. What kind of things are they? How do we know they exist?
                \item Epistemological weirdness: Even if there were a plausible ontological account of objective moral values, how could we come to know them?
            \end{itemize}
            \item The argument from cultural relativism: \newline Premise | Societies differ markedly in their moral values. \newline Conclusion | There are no objective moral values.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Thomas Nagel}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Thomas Nagel} (a moral realist) admits that there is \textbf{atleast one very general value} that is \textbf{objective}.
        \item \textbf{Thomas Nagel}'s goal is to find \textbf{at least one objective moral value} thereby contradicting \textbf{Mackie's moral skepticism}.
        \item To find at least one \textbf{objective moral value}, \textbf{Nagel uses "the view from nowhere"}.
        \item \textbf{The view from nowhere} involves \textbf{bracketing ourselves off} from the \textbf{world} and our \textbf{relationships} with people in the world. Essentially we stand back and look at our lives and the world we live in as a whole.
        \item According to Nagel, \textbf{the view from nowhere} abandons the \textbf{subjective viewpoint} leaving only an \textbf{objective viewpoint}.
        \item Nagel argues that \textbf{a maximally objective value} found by \textbf{increasing levels of abstraction} will have \textbf{three characteristics}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The value will be \textbf{broad in scope}, it will apply to many different kinds of actions.
            \item The value will be \textbf{agent-neutral}, meaning it won't involve any reference to anyone.
            \item The value will be \textbf{external}, meaning that it won't refer to anyone's reasons for acting.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Nagel warns about \textbf{the danger of taking the view from nowhere} is that if the value is \textbf{too abstract} is becomes \textbf{vacuous} (For example: Be good).
    \end{itemize}
