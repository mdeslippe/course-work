    \section*{\centering{Use Cases}}

    \subsection*{Software Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{software requirement} is:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A \textbf{condition or capability} needed by a \textbf{user} to \textbf{solve a problem} or \textbf{achieve an objective}.
            \item A \textbf{condition or capability} that must be \textbf{satisfied by a system}.
            \item A \textbf{documented representation} of a \textbf{condition or capability} as described in (1) and (2).
        \end{enumerate}
        \item A \textbf{functional requirement} is a requirement that \textbf{describes what a system must do} including \textbf{processes, interfaces, and data}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Function requirements} are described in \textbf{use case documents}, and are modelled in \textbf{OOA} with \textbf{use case diagrams, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{non-functional requirement} is a requirement that \textbf{specifies how the system must perform} including \textbf{response time, security considerations, and the volume of data}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Non-functional requirements} are documented in a \textbf{requirement list}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{usability requirement} is a requirement that is concerned with \textbf{matching the system to the way people work}.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Usability requirements} measure objectives, including \textbf{characteristics of users, tasks users undertake, situational factors, and the acceptance of criteria for the working system}.
                \item \textbf{Usability requirements} are documented in the \textbf{list of requirements} and may be tested by \textbf{prototypes}.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Techniques for Finding Requirements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are \textbf{several techniques for finding requirements}.
        \item \textbf{Background reading} is a technique for finding \textbf{requirements} that aims at \textbf{understanding the organization} and it's \textbf{business objectives}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reading material includes \textbf{reports, charts, policies, job descriptions, and existing system documentation}.
            \item This technique \textbf{works best} in the \textbf{initial stage of fact finding} and when the \textbf{analyst is not familia with the organization}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Interviewing} is a technique for getting an \textbf{in-depth understanding} of the \textbf{organization's objectives, and user roles}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interview subjects include \textbf{managers, staff, and customers}.
            \item This technique \textbf{works best} when \textbf{in-depth} information is required. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the skill of the interviewer.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Observation} is a technique for find out what \textbf{really happens}, \textbf{not what people say happens}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Items to observe include \textbf{what happens to documents, how people carry out processes, quantitative data, a processes from end-to-end}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Document sampling} is a technique for \textbf{providing statistical data} about \textbf{transaction volumes} and \textbf{activity patterns}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Document sampling information includes \textbf{copies of empty and completed documents, screenshots of existing systems, numbers of forms filled in, and the lines on the forms}. 
            \item This technique \textbf{works best} when \textbf{error rates are high, large volumes of data are being processes}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Questionnaires} are a technique for obtaining the \textbf{views of a large amount of people in a way that can be analyzed statistically}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Questionnaires include \textbf{postal, web-based, and email questionnaires with open-ended and closed-ended questions}. They also \textbf{gather opinions and facts}.
            \item This technique \textbf{works best} when \textbf{staff organizations are geographically dispersed, the system is going to be used by the general public, and when you need to obtain the views of a large amount of people}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{\centering{Use Case Descriptions}}

    \subsection*{Use Case Modeling}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{use case} is primarily an \textbf{action of writing text}.
        \item An \textbf{actor} is a \textbf{person or thing} that \textbf{interacts} with the software.
        \item A \textbf{use case} describes \textbf{what happens in the system} when an \textbf{actor uses the software}.
        \item \textbf{Use case modeling} may include a \textbf{use case diagram}; showing the \textbf{name, actors, and relationships} of \textbf{use cases}.
        \item \textbf{Use case development is a key characteristic} of the \textbf{Unified Process}. It serves to help discover \textbf{functional requirements, design construction, test plans, and maintenance to prepare user manuals}.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection*{Types of Use Case Descriptions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are \textbf{3 types} of \textbf{use case descriptions}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A \textbf{brief use case description} consists of a \textbf{single paragraph} describing the \textbf{main success scenario}.
            \item A \textbf{casual use case description} consists of \textbf{multiple informal paragraphs} covering both the \textbf{main success scenario}, and \textbf{various alternatives}.
            \item A \textbf{fully dressed use case description} consists of a \textbf{detailed description of all steps involved in the main success, alternative, and exception scenarios}. This is usually accompanied by supporting sections, such as pre-conditions and post-conditions.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The \textbf{fully dressed use case description} contains the following sections:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{The primary actor} - The user who interacts with the system during this use case.
            \item \textbf{Stakeholders and their interests} - The use case covers the functionality that satisfies all the required stakeholder's interests.
            \item \textbf{Pre-conditions} - Conditions that must be true before the main scenario begins without any checking.
            \item \textbf{Post-conditions} - Conditions that must be true on the successful completion of a use case.
            \item \textbf{The main success scenario (detailed)} - The typical path to a successful outcome (describes what needs to happen not how).
            \item \textbf{Alternative flows (detailed)}. - All other paths that may lead to a success or failure.
            \item \textbf{Exceptions (detailed)}. Exceptions that may occur.
            \item \textbf{Special requirements} - Non-functional requirements for the use case.
            \item \textbf{Open issues} - Anything that hs an effect on the functionality of the use case.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
